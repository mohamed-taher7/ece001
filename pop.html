<h1>Programming languages</h1>
<p>The choice of the programming language is made depending on the requirement, and we will discuss the most popular languages, but after talking about how programming languages works.</p>
<h2>How they work?</h2>
<p>Machines only understand BINARY language as the processor is built from millions or billions of transistors that only understand electricity in terms of 0(low voltage current not zero current) and 1, so what programming language do?, they make programming much easier as the binary language is impossible to learn, but since machines only understand binary so there is something called compiler or interpreter that converts the syntax of the language that user put to machine language</p>
<p>So, what is the most popular programming languages?</p>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Python is an easy to learn and advanced language of programming that is interpreted, object-oriented, and based on scalable and stable semantics.</p>
<p>Perhaps Python is the most user-friendly programming language on this list of all. Python is syntax is also said to be simple , intuitive and almost English-like, making it a common choice for beginners, like Java.</p>
<p>Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design, Web and Internet development (frameworks, micro-frameworks and advanced content management systems), YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey are all</p>
<p>built-in Python, desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), it is easy learning language, with a lot of libraries that can be used in major fields like AI, machine learning, scientific, mathematically, automation of tedious work.</p>
<p>For instance, Python offers Django and Flask, popular web development libraries, and data science applications such as TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy.</p>
<p>But it is&quot; not suitable for mobile computing, slower because it is interpreted and database access layer is immature&quot;</p>
<h2>Java</h2>
<p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented, general purpose programming language with many features that make it suitable for communications, web-based development, finance, health sciences, hospitality, retail and utilities, Internet of Things (IoT), Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite, Android apps, Eclipse, Lotus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice are built by java.</p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>Is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications, it is relatively easy to learn, but other languages would be more easier to learn after learning it.</p>
<p>Business, software developers, computer engineers and systems analysts, IT and Web content administrators, embedded software engineers and is used by employers in Healthcare, Professional Services Information Technology, Engineering, Management.</p>
<h2>C++</h2>
<p>The most difficult one to learn, but it is the mother of all languages, C++ is ideal for resource limited applications, and supports those who choose to write professional code. Despite the introduction of several new programming languages, C++ is still evolving, and people from different backgrounds use it.</p>
<p>Though, it is a great language for huge projects like creating operating systems due it is speed and salability.</p>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>It is very popular client-side programming language for web development, it runs on a compuer side rather than server, WordPress, Soundcloud, Khan Academy, Linkedin, Groupon, Yahoo and many others are built with javascript, it is not easy to learn but it has many framework to work with, JavaScript is commonly used for creating interactive frontend applications. For example, the logic is implemented via JavaScript when you click on a button which opens a popup.</p>
