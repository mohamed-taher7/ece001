<h1>What is an IDE</h1>
<p>Integrated development environment is a software designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing interconnected components with similar user interfaces. IDEs offer one program in which all development takes place. This program usually provides many advantages for writing, editing, compiling, publishing and correcting programs. This contrasts with software development using unrelated tools, such as vi,</p>
<p>GCC or Pycharm, learning how to use IDE would be very useful for programming but not in the very early stage of learning any programming language.</p>
<h1>How programming affect our world</h1>
<p>We dont live anymore in a world where we can separate our online and offline activities, everything digital around us is made by programming even the automatic washing machine,</p>
<p>Operating systems, softwares, mobile applications, microcontrollers, some cars, all science topics uses programming.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>There is a lot of programming languages are in the wild, but learning all of them is not a must it depends on your discipline or your requirements, and they have huge impact in our life cause most of us uses technology in a direct or indirect way, so we should pay attention to all new technologies uses code in some sort of way, so learning a programming language and choosing a good one that fit to individual requirement would improve peoples life</p>
