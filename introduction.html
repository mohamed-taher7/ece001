<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>Computer programming languages is a language used to program machines, every
machine or smartphone around us uses it, from microcontroller that used in various of
technologies around us like automatic washing machines and industrial PLC, actually
all sciences disciplines from biology to AI uses programming languages,
programming languages uses instructions in a language that both humans and
computers understand, just as there are many languages based on humans, there is a
syntax of computer programming languages that programmers can use to
communicate with a computer.
The first code and compiler for the Mark 1 computer at Manchester University was
developed in 1952 and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming
language.
These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex
swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized 10000
words and was asked to place them alphabetically, chances are that it will take a
sizable amount of time and include some errors.
There are a lot of programming languages used in the industry today, example of the
active ones are Java, Python, C++, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, Php, scala (language
that aim to face java’s criticism) these languages are distinct in it’s usage and syntax,
they can be classified according to their applications or to their Paradigms (OOP for
example) or to how much active and popular the language are, we will use the third
approach for the research.</p>
